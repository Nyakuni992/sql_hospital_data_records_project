Welcome to the **hospital_data_records_project** repository⚕️

This project illustrates an in-depth data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating operational insights. This project is designed as a portfolio project and It showcases industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

## 🔷 Data Architecture

This project adopts the Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers for it's data design :
![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: This layer stores raw data exactly as received from source systems, ingested from CSV files into the SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: “In this layer data is cleansed, standardized, and normalized to ensure analytical readiness.”
3. **Gold Layer**: This layer contains Business-ready datasets that are structured using the star schema to enable efficient reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Involves Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the sql database.
3. **Data Modeling**: Formulating fact and dimension tables that are efficient for analytical queries
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Developing SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

## 🪢 Project Requirements

### Building the Hospital Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Build a contemporary hospital data warehouse with SQL Server to consolidate patient records and supporting the analysis of patient behavior.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from the hospital-patient records provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve any data quality issues before analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine related data sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Documentation**: "Provide thorough documentation of the data model to assist stakeholders,hospital administrators and analytics teams.

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

#### Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Patient-encounter Overview**
- **Cost and Coverage Insights**
- **Patient Behavioural Analysis**

These clinical insights provide stakeholders, hospital administrators, and multidisciplinary care teams with critical healthcare performance indicators, facilitating evidence-based, strategic decision-making
